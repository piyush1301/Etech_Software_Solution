Agent-Freehand : I apologize for how you feel, Robert. 

Let me open your account and check the best plan available on your account.
Agent-Freehand : I can see that you are currently logged in to your account. Please give me a moment while I pull up your account.
Customer : Thank You!
Agent-Freehand : My pleasure.
Agent-Freehand : Thank you for your patience.
Agent-Freehand : I see you are currently subscribed to 11/11 Mbps (FREE upgraded speed of 11/11 Mbps) + Preferred TV plan + ABC Home phone at the bundle price of $111.11 before taxes and equipment fee. 

Keeping the same services, with a new 1 year plan, I see the bundle price would be just $111.11 before taxes and $111.11 with taxes and equipment fee. This price includes $1 Auto Pay and Paper Free Discount.
Agent-Freehand : How does the offer sound, Robert?
Agent-Freehand : I hope I have not lost you. Just to confirm, are we still connected?
Customer : YEA im here just busy sorry
Agent-Freehand : Please do not be sorry. I understand.
Customer : 111.11 but i have to sign up for auto pay?
Agent-Freehand : Yes, with Auto Pay, you get an additional $1 discount. Without unrolling n Auto pay, the bill would be approx $111 with taxes.
Agent-Freehand : Robert, you also get $111 toward Google and Nest smart home devices  with this new 1 year contract offer.
Customer : How about a 111 gift card? sounds high? cant do anything better
Agent-Freehand : I would have  loved to give $111 Gift Card but currently, there is no such offer for including the Gift Card.
Agent-Freehand : Please be rest assured, the offer and the planI shared is the best available on your account.
Customer : optimum is offering me a little better though...no loyalty  discount? i have ABC wireless too?
Agent-Freehand : I completely understand price would be a concern, Robert. I'm here to help you and out of all the offers I check, I see the one that we discussed is the best available on your account for keeping what you currently have.
Agent-Freehand : You're in good hands!
Customer : hahaha that's cute im in good hands..lol
Agent-Freehand : Thank you.
Agent-Freehand : Nice to meet you, this morning. Hope you are doing well.
