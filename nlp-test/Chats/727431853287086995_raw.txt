Agent-Freehand : Hey there! My name is Ian. I will be glad to share information on this.
Agent-Freehand : You will need at least 1 Set top box to order ABC ABC Triple Play for your ABC ABC TV service.
Agent-Freehand : A Set Top Box allows you to watch standard definition and HD channels & programming. You will also be able to access over 111,111 monthly Video On Demand movies and shows.
Agent-Freehand : You won't get the channels without Set top box. So, its better to select at least 1 Set top box for getting ABC ABC TV channels on at least one of your TV.
Agent-Freehand : Just to confirm, does this answer your question?
Customer : yea, so I have to pay that $11/mo basically if I want to go for Triple Play.
Agent-Freehand : Yes, that's right.
Customer : Is there a way I can be qualified for the $111 Google and Nest promotion without the extra $11/mo?
Agent-Freehand : It looks like ABC ABC TV service is required to bundle with ABC ABC Internet to qualify for $111 Google and Nest promotion with 1 year agreement.
Agent-Freehand : Just to confirm, how you are going to access your ABC ABC TV without Set top box?
Customer : we don't really watch TV...
Agent-Freehand : In this case, you can select at least 1 Set top box for getting ABC ABC TV service and qualify for $111 Google and Nest promotion.
Customer : Got it. Thanks.
Agent-Freehand : My pleasure! Just to confirm, would you like to go ahead and complete your online order now?
Customer : Not really. Thanks though.
Agent-Freehand : I can understand that. However, if you want, you may select a Digital Adapter worth $1.11/month price instead of Set top box.
Agent-Freehand : The Motorola DCT 111 Digital Adapter provides digital access to only local, premium, and national standard definition channels.
Not compatible with the following: HD Channels, Video On Demand, Impulse PPV, Interactive Media Guide, TV listings, parental controls, Home Media DVR, Media Manager and games.
Agent-Freehand : Just to confirm, would that work for you?
Agent : I havenâ€™t heard from you for a few moments. Would you like to continue chatting?
Customer : I'll think about it. Thanks.
Customer : Customer closed the chat window.
