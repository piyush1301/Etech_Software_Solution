Agent : Hey there! My name is Nestor. Happy to help!
Agent : Thank you for your years of loyalty to ABC!
Customer : Hi
Agent-Freehand : Good evening! How may I assist you today?
Customer : Just checking to see why my bill was $11 higher this month
Customer : do you know why?
Agent-Freehand : Thank you for contacting and giving us an opportunity to serve you. I will be glad to look in to your bill and check what all things have been changed. Please give me few moments while I pull up your account and bills.
Agent-Freehand : I can see that you are currently logged in to your account. Thank you for safeguarding your account.
Agent-Freehand : I am going through your bills. Please allow me a few minutes to gather some information for you.
Customer : okay
Agent-Freehand : I appreciate your patience.
Agent-Freehand : Joseph, upon working on your bills, I see that you last month bundle price was $111.11 as the contract expired on 11/11/1111 the bundle price changed to $111.11 as this is the reason the bundle price is changed. Also on your last bill you purchased a movie Quiet Place,AHD1:11pm which had a charge of $11.11 as this is the reason the price was $111.11/mo after the taxes and fees.
Customer : how do I get my bundle price back to 111.11?
Customer : or less
Agent-Freehand : let me check the renewal deals for you.
Agent-Freehand : I am checking for the renewal deals and I see that the current plan which you are having is the best and at the right price. As you have been our loyal ABC customer your discounts are extended till 11/11/1111.
Agent-Freehand : I would recommend you to continue with the same contract for a year more so that you get the best renewal deal for you at cost effective price.
Customer : how do I do that?
Customer : there's a plan for 111.11
Customer : is that the one?
Agent-Freehand : Yes I checked for the same but the total prices and taxes are coming out more than the current monthly bill.
Agent-Freehand : It is because the current discounts are in is the best and if we are renewing the new discounts are getting CONLFICT and the prices are increasing more.
Customer : so do I leave ABC for anther service?
Agent-Freehand : ABC has to increase rates from time to time to offset higher costs and to keep investing in our network to continue providing unsurpassed performance and reliability. We work hard to deliver more value for your money!
Agent-Freehand : If you take the $111.11 deal your new monthly bill will be $111.11/mo after the taxes and fees.
Customer : so what are you saying?
Customer : I can't get my original deal back?
Agent-Freehand : I am really sorry but the last price won't be possible as because it is the 1 year old price which you locked in at that time.
Agent-Freehand : If you wish to renew now it will be $111.11/mo after the taxes and fees. With this contract you are getting $1 Auto Pay and Paper Free Discount + $11 ABC Bundle Discount Included + $111 toward Google and Nest devices
Customer : Thanks but I am going to get a different service for less money
Agent : While comparing services, you might want to keep in mind that with cable you might end up sharing your internet speeds with your neighbors. This isn't the case with ABC. We offer you reliability and quality that you deserve.
Agent-Freehand : I understand that our competitors are offering some lucrative rates for services; however, once their introductory period expires their price hikes to almost double. Unlike our competitors at ABC we value our customer and we are committed to give them best value for their money. I can assure you that you will not find the same quality of service at the same rates with our competitors while renewing the services.
Customer : Thanks
Agent-Freehand : Michael, shall the customize the new renewal deal and send you in e-mail to review?
Customer : who is Michael?
Agent-Freehand : I am really sorry for the typing name, it is Joseph. I apologize for my mistake.
Customer : I'm not interested in the new deal that costs more money
Agent-Freehand : I understand your pricing concern.
Agent : What are your must have TV stations/networks?
Customer : I have very basic channels now
Agent-Freehand : Yes the current TV plan which you have is the Select HD but with the renewal deal I shared with you you will be getting Preferred TV HD.
Agent-Freehand : I would recommend our ABC TV Preferred HD Plan. With a great mix of entertainment, you can watch exciting sports, music, comedy and travel programming! Some of USA's favorite channels included are MTV, Comedy Central, Fox News, TNT, ABC, Disney, Nickelodeon, Animal Planet, ESPN and regional sports as part of the 111+ channels plan.
Customer : I just need what I currently have
Agent-Freehand : Then I would recommend you to not make any changes as of now. The price will be $11 more than what you are paying.
Customer : okay
Agent-Freehand : There will be no other discounts expiring till 11/11/1111.
Customer : okay
Agent-Freehand : Thank you for understanding.
