Customer : Sorry I should have been more specific, If I decide to renew the $111.11 deal and cancel in a month or two....
Customer : There is no way to get a discount on the Multi room DVR, I was only paying $11.11 month...
Agent-Freehand : I understand. Early termination fee will be $111 which depends on the number of months remaining in contract.
Customer : Any wiggle on the Mutli room DVR cost per month...
Agent-Freehand : Let me check
Agent-Freehand : I have checked however currently the best price available for Multi-Room DVR Premium Service is $11.11
Customer : So that is nothing you can do, that stinks, what if I went to only 1 DVR in one room  does that help the price???   Do you offer any corporate discounts, I get a discount on my ABC wireless through my company does that extend to Residental
