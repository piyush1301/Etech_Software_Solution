Customer : And my bill for last month spiked for $11
Agent-Freehand : Ohh, that is devastating!

Customer : Yes, which was 11.11 before this month.
Customer : which I understand if I were to shut and service and reopen, would be even cheaper...

Customer : Would you at least give the same deal?
Agent-Freehand : Let me do some research
Customer : Thank you!

Customer : When I started, I paid for 11.11, and then 11.11, and now 111.11...
Agent-Freehand : Yes, I understand your point. however, the thing is such that the prices that you were paying were with the promotions that are now expired.
Customer : Could you not apply some of the same promotions
Customer : If I started over again, I wouldn't even have to pay $111 with the new promotions...
Agent-Freehand : I am sorry, the promotions are attached to the contract term.

Customer : Some streaming
Customer : I like the same plan. It is really just about the pricing
Agent-Freehand : Sure thing!

Customer : Pretty basic
Customer : The ones I have are fine for now
Agent-Freehand : Alright!
Agent-Freehand : I see that there are no good promotions available if you are to stay with the current TV plan.

I see that if you are to switch to the Custom TV plan, there are some promotions that I can add like getting your new bundle price to $11.11 a month that currently is $111.11 a month.

Plus, I see that you can get $111 credit towards a range of Google and Nest smart home devices with this bundle with new 1-year agreement.

Customer : Let me look at this.
Agent-Freehand : Sure thing!
Agent-Freehand : I will be right here to answer any of the questions that may arise.
Customer : So I guess this would just be a downgrade on the TV front, which will make the bundle price $11 cheaper?
Agent-Freehand : No, I would not call it a downgrade. I would call it a right size of the service. The service that gets you what you want.
Customer : What would be the difference in channels between the one I have and for example if I were to pick sports and news
Agent-Freehand : Let me share that.
