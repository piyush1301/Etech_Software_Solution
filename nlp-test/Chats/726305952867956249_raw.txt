Agent-Freehand : What is the error message you are getting on the screen?
Customer : We have already tried cutting it off, rebooting, everything.  We called the other night and spoke to an agent.  But they did not document our call.  So when my nephew tried to take the box in and get another one, he was told there was no report on file.

Agent : Please provide the serial number of the non working Set Top Box. It is located underneath the box which begins either with "M" or “P”.
Customer : My nephew has it in his jeep to return.  I don't have it in here.  Can he give you that when he turns it in tomorrow?  
Customer : I called earlier today and they said there was over an hour wait and I should try online.  
Customer : So I'm doing that but didn't know I would need the box
Agent-Freehand : When we create the replacement, the set-top box gets deactivated and the new one would be activated, so, we need a serial number.
