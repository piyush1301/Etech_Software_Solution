Agent-Freehand : No worries! If required, you can upgrade or downgrade your TV plan anytime.
Customer : and the phone line is free?
Agent-Freehand : It will be same price in bundle package; however, taxes on phone service will be additional.
Customer : so, with the free digital adaptor it says that it doesn't have features like HD

Customer : is that dependant on my current tv?
Agent-Freehand : Yes, you'll not be able to watch HD channels, On Demand, Media Guide, Parental controls etc.. with Digital adapter.
Agent-Freehand : It will only allow to watch standard channels.

Agent-Freehand : Yes, you'll need HD box to watch all channels. It will be $11/mo. for HD box.
Customer : okay
Customer : so I need to add the DVR box for $11 or $11?
Agent-Freehand : Please select "NO" for Digital adapter and select 1 under "how many additional TV's" option to get 1 HD box.
Agent-Freehand : DVR is for recording capabilities on TV's and it will be additional on top of HD box charge.
Customer : got it
Customer : if I chose a DVR, does it include the HD box?
Agent-Freehand : It does not include HD box.
Agent-Freehand : It is service added on HD box.
Agent-Freehand : So, it will be $11 for HD box + $11 for DVR service = $11/mo.
