Agent-Freehand : Sure!
Agent-Freehand : Here is the TV channel line up:


Customer : A quick look and I'm wondering without holding you up the difference between level 1 and level 1.  I still see espn, hallmark, hgtv, and the news networks on the first level
Customer : what is the price difference between the two
Agent-Freehand : Can you please share with me the TV plan name?
Customer : ultimate vs. extreme i think I once was offered this and found out I didn't get something with ultimate that matee
Customer : mattered
Customer : i can't actually see the entire body that I type
Customer : I'm just not seeing what the difference is between the two packages without a thorough study
Agent-Freehand : You currently have Extreme HD TV plan
Customer : right.  and i'm curious about ultimate
Agent-Freehand : Ultimate HD TV plan included more channels and is around $11/mo more
Agent-Freehand : Includes SHowtime,Starz and Epix for FREE
Agent-Freehand : And 111+ TV channels
Customer : right.  but a quick scan and I can't see what's missing.  Okay, good, I don't watch those
Customer : so that isn't needed.  We watch all ESPN, HGTV, Hallmark, and the basic network stations
