Opener :  Opener: Hi! I am a ABC specialist, can I help you today?
Customer : Hi I just noticed that my bill just went up from $11/month to $11/month, apparently because my 1-year contract expired.  Are there any options for discounts available to me?
Agent : By chatting with us, you grant us permission to review your services during the chat to offer the best value. Refusing to chat will not affect your current services. It is your right and our duty to protect your account information. For quality, we may monitor and/or review this chat.
Agent : Agent 'abc@abc.com' enters chat (as Tyrone)
Agent : Hey there! My name is Tyrone. Happy to help!
Agent-Freehand : Thank you for being a valued ABC Customer. I will be glad to check available renewal discounts for you!
Agent-Freehand : May I know if you're logged in to your account?
Customer : I am, yes.
Agent-Freehand : Great! Give me a moment.
Agent-Freehand : I can see you have had ABC 111/111 Mbps plan in your profile and your agreement expired on 11/11/1111.
Customer : Correct
Agent-Freehand : You have had Introductory discounts in your profile for being a new customer and you still have got $11/mo discount valid for 11 more months in your profile. If we make changes to your services now, price will either increase or stays the same because the new customer discounts won't be available again. 

The best we can do for your plan is $11.11/mo for 1 years with a new agreement and autopay.
Agent : Agent 'abc@abc.com' loses connection
Customer : Wait, so if I have a $11/month valid for the next 11 months, why is my bill saying it's for $11?
Customer : Hello?

Agent-Freehand : Wish you a very good morning! May I know with whom do I have pleasure of chatting today?
Customer : Chris Detwiller.  I was in the middle of a chat with a different agent that got disconnected, do you have that transcript
Customer : ?
Customer : Hi I just noticed that my bill just went up from $11/month to $11/month, apparently because my 1-year contract expired. The person said " You have had Introductory discounts in your profile for being a new customer and you still have got $11/mo discount valid for 11 more months in your profile.

Agent-Freehand : Thank you for sharing the information.
Customer : my question back was, so if I have a $11/month valid for the next 11 months, why is my bill saying it's for $11?
Agent-Freehand : Let  me pullout the account to check the bill and the charges
Agent-Freehand : I can see that you are currently logged in to your account. Thank you for safeguarding your account.
Agent-Freehand : I have gone through the bill and I see your contract has expired on 11/11/1111, and the base charges has increased however still you have $11.11 for the base charge of $111.11 for ABC Internet 111/111
Agent-Freehand : To be sure, are we still connected?
Customer : Yes
Agent-Freehand : Okay.
Customer : so is that $11.11 what the bill should be, or is that the discount off of $111.11, making the bill $11?
Agent-Freehand : The base charge is $111.11 for which you are getting $11.11 off till 1/1/11.
Agent-Freehand : Which makes it $11
Customer : oh i see.  so i think the last guy said if i signed up for another 1 years i could get a bit of a discount?
Agent-Freehand : I have checked for the available renewal option and I see the charges would be same as you have currently i,e $11.11 after taxes
Customer : oh ok.  i thought he said it would be $11.11 if i did it and signed up for autopay?
Agent-Freehand : Yes that's correct too.
Customer : so how do i do that?
Agent-Freehand : Let me do that for you,
Agent-Freehand : May I know if you have access to abc@abc.com?
Customer : would i also get the chromecast 1k ultra?
Customer : yes i do have access to abc@abc.com
Agent-Freehand : Yes it includes Free Google Chromecast
Agent-Freehand : Chris, I am sending you a link in the email with the deal for the new contract.
