Customer : I don't need a multi-room DVR since we only have one TV and I'm not too interested in Google or Nest devices. Can you do any better?
Agent : This is a fantastic entertainment package, customized to meet your needs!
Agent-Freehand : If we change to regular DVR you will lose the discount with the Multi Room DVR as the cost of HD Set top box will be $11 + DVR services $11. You are getting Multi Room DVR with HD Set top box at just $11.11

Customer : sorry
Customer : So if we do a single room DVR it is $11 per month instead of $11.11? Did i read that right?
Agent-Freehand : Yes, the DVR service itself is is $11/mo and HD Set top box will be $11/mo. So, it would be $11/mo for the package which you are paying at $11.11
Customer : So there is no way to get the price down from $11.11 without losing HD?
Agent-Freehand : Let me check.
Agent-Freehand : Since you have signed up for Auto Pay and Paper Free billing, we will offer you $1 further discount on it and your final bill will be just $111.11/mo including taxes and fees.
