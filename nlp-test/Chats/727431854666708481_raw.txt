Agent-Freehand : Please give me few moments while I gather some information on your request.
Customer : thank you brandon. I saw that the same plan i have is offered to new customers at the same rate i was paying before (11.11 plus the 11 rent fee) and i was just hoping to get that again, im on a very tight budget and just cant afford anything else as embarrassing as that is
Agent-Freehand : I will check that for you and if the deal is available, I will share with you.
Agent-Freehand : Christina, I have checked your account and I would like to share that the same deal is currently unavailable in the account.
Customer : ok
Agent-Freehand : However, we can offer you 11/11 Mbps without any free 111/111 Mbps at $11.11 price. We can also go with 111/111 Mbps at $11.11 deal.
Customer : if i do the 11/11 will it still go up $11.11 for the rent fee or does that price include the rent fee
Agent-Freehand : Yes, you are correct!
Agent-Freehand : Let me share a deal with you.
Agent-Freehand : We can do the 11/11 Mbps plan at $11.11 + Rent: ABC Quantum Gateway Router = $11.11 + taxes and fees. With this deal we will offer you further $1 Auto Pay and Paper Free Discount and Free Google Chromecast.
Agent-Freehand : If we go with deal and enroll in AutoPay and Paper Free billing, your monthly bill will be just $11.11/mo including taxes and fees.
Agent-Freehand : You can purchase the router further at $111.11 to save $11/mo on rental.
Customer : if i dont do autopay does it go up to $11.11 a month
Agent-Freehand : It will be $1/mo more without Auto Pay.
Customer : okay. 
Customer : can you tell me when the actual discount expires, as in the day i should call and cancel the account
Agent-Freehand : Your discount will expire on 11/11/1111
Customer : all i wanmt is for my bill to stay the same. My plan is offered to new customers at a lower rate so i just dont understand why the same deals cant be extended to good customers, i mean i never even pay my bill late.
Customer : okay thank you.
Agent-Freehand : I understand your concern.  All new customers are offered incentives and promotions at the time of their initial order; therefore, when you placed your order as a new customer, you received the promotion that was being offered at that time.
Agent-Freehand : We value you as a long-time customer and do have special offer like Free Chromecast that you can take advantage of as well.
Agent-Freehand : I would have been more than happy if I could have helped you with the same price. However, as the deal is unavailable, we would not be able to share with you.
Customer : its fine thank you.
Agent-Freehand : You are welcome.
Agent-Freehand : Can you think of any additional questions that I can assist you with today?
Customer : no thsnk you.
