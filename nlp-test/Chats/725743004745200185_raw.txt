Customer : how long am i locked in?
Agent : Hey there! My name is Alice. Happy to help!
Agent-Freehand : Just to be sure, are you referring to Gigabit triple play?
Customer : yes
Agent-Freehand : You can go with a 1 year contract. Even we offer triple play with no contract.
Agent-Freehand : Please stay connected to the chat session in the ordering process so that I can ensure that the setup fees of $11.11 is waived for you.
Customer : if i go w/o contract 
Customer : how long does the price stay $11
Agent-Freehand : I would like to say that 11.11 is just the bundle price before taxes, fees and equipment charges and without contract the price is good for 11 months.
Customer : how much is the total after all fees
Customer : whats my monthly payment?
Agent-Freehand : Let me check that for you.
Agent-Freehand : Just top be sure, is this your address: 1111  E 11BROOKLYN NY 11111?
Customer : correct
Agent-Freehand : Thank you for confirming.
Agent : While I take care of this for you, let me ask you a few questions to make sure you arenâ€™t missing out on anything.
Agent : Tell me how you and your household are using the internet.  For example: Online gaming, working from home, and/or streaming.
Customer : waiting on your reply - not relevant what we do
Agent-Freehand : Okay. Allow me a moment.
Customer : ?
Agent-Freehand : Allow me a moment. I am calculating the estimate.
Agent-Freehand : Triple Play:
ABC Gigabit Connection + Custom TV Home & Family + ABC Digital Voice US+11 Countries = $11.11 + Rent: ABC Quantum Gateway Router $11 + Rent: HD Set-Top Box $11 = $111.11 + taxes and fees = $111.11 /mo
Customer : lets say i went with just phone and gigbit internet
Agent-Freehand : Allow me a moment.
Customer : i beleive theres no rental charge
Customer : so then its $11/month plus taxes and fees how much is that?
Agent-Freehand : If you purchase the router for $111.11, then you can avoid the rental charge for the router.
Agent-Freehand : Double Play:
ABC Gigabit Connection + ABC Digital Voice US+11 Countries = $11.11 + Rent: ABC Quantum Gateway Router $11 = $11.11 + taxes and fees = $111.11 /mo
Customer : so whats the diff between 1 month or 1-11...?
Agent-Freehand : No difference. From month 1 - 11, you will have to pay the same price.
Customer : i guess what im trying to understand is
Customer : im not locked into any contract - its month to month?
Customer : how long is the price locked in for?
Agent-Freehand : Yes its month to month.
Agent-Freehand : and the price is good for 11 montrhs.
Customer : and if i select longer - does that lock me into a contract?
Agent-Freehand : I am so sorry we offer internet and phone only on month to month basis.
Customer : k
Customer : so the price is locked in for 11 months
Agent-Freehand : Yes. Thats right.
Customer : what des this mean
Customer : Get a $111 credit toward a range of Google and Nest smart home devices with qualifying triple play and double play bundles with a 1-year agreement.
