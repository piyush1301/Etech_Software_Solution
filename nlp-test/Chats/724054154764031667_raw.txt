Agent-Freehand : Thank you for waiting, I appreciate your patience.
Agent-Freehand : I can see that your contract is ending on 11/11/1111, the bundle price remains the same but the taxes and fees will increase some what.
Customer : so what is the difference between  the new agreement of 111.11 versus my current plan of 111.11 beside the price, do I get the same package for 111.11?
Agent-Freehand : Please allow me to check that for you,.
Customer : Thanks
Agent-Freehand : You are welcome.
Agent-Freehand : I can see that the $111.11 deal is the same services that you currently have with the $111 credit for Google Nest Products.
Customer : what is google nest products?
Agent-Freehand : Let me share the link with you where you can check the Google nest products.
Customer : if I want to extend my agreement for the next 1 years and keep everything the same the price of 111.11 stays the same.
Agent-Freehand : 
Agent-Freehand : I apologize, but keeping the price same is not possible as the price of the services and the taxes have increased.
Customer : You told me that the 111.11 is the same service I have with a 111.11 google nest service credit
Agent-Freehand : Yes! that is the same services with lower overall price.
Customer : So I can go with the 111.11 and keep my plan as is and also get a 111.11 credit with the google nest offer
Agent-Freehand : Yes! You can.
Agent-Freehand : Your current price of the deal is $111.11 including the taxes and fees, but the new deal with the Google nest offer is $111.11 including the taxes and fees.
Agent-Freehand : What do you think of the deal?
Customer : I am not really into the google gigabit connection idea. I just want to keep things as they are, so what are my other options?
Agent-Freehand : The services will remain the same as it is. No changes made to the services.
Customer : ok so if I don’t get the google gigabit connection, shouldn’t my package be lower in price
Agent-Freehand : The Google offer is not for the internet, but the Google nest products.
Agent-Freehand : Now once you renew the agreement with new deal the Google offer is by default offered.
Customer : so what is my monthly cost to keep everything as is, with no changes?
Agent-Freehand : Your monthly cost keeping all the services will be $111.11.
Agent-Freehand : Would you like to continue?
Customer : that price of 111.11 covers tv,internet, and land line?
Agent-Freehand : Yes! That is correct.
Customer : ok so what do I have to do to get this set up or will you do it now
