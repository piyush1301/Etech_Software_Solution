Agent-Freehand : Thank you for sharing this information.
Agent-Freehand : I would like to inform, ABC Gigabit connection is the best internet plan for you. With that you will get blazing speed of 111Mbps download and 111Mbps upload speed. It is almost 11 times faster to what you currently have.
Agent-Freehand : And if we go with a 1 year contract we are getting better discounts with the internet speed upgrade.
Customer : my view, based on the current plan offerings is i am paying too much for slow speed
Customer : and my equiptment is out dated and slow
Agent-Freehand : Yes, I completely understand that, it is only because you are on month to month contract, with that you are not getting any bundle discounts.
Customer : forget about that part, what is the pricing for better speed.
Agent-Freehand : I can see if we go with a 1 year contract and upgrade the internet speed to ABC Gigabit connection, your monthly charges will be $111.11 /mo before taxes and fees.
Including taxes and fees the total comes up to $111.11 /mo.
Agent-Freehand : There will be a one time charge of $11 for this speed upgrade.
Agent-Freehand : Our tech team will visit your location and will upgrade the whole ONT and will change the wiring, so that you get better speeds.
Customer : and what is the price after the contract?
Customer : not sure i need tha tmuch spee
Customer : sorry, not sure i need that much speed
Customer : 111 or 111 would be fine
Agent-Freehand : Please be assured that we will offer you the best rates available after 11 months. We cannot guarantee any rates at the time being; however, we can assure you that we always offer the lowest rates possible to our new and current customers.
Agent-Freehand : Sure, please allow me a moment to check the pricing with 111Mbps.
Agent-Freehand : I can see if we go with 111/111Mbps, your monthly charges will be $111.11 /mo before taxes and fees.
Including taxes and fees the total will be $111.11/mo. 
And the one time charge of $11 will be there if we upgrade the speed to 111Mbps or more.
