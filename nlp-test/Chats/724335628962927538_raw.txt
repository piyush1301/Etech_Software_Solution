Customer : ok
Agent-Freehand : Just to be sure . Could you please let me know the offer that you selected?
Customer : its 111.11/mo gigabit connection digital voice, ultimate tv
Customer : plus get 111 toward google and nest devices
Agent-Freehand : Thank you for the clarification.
Agent-Freehand : I can see that you are currently logged in to your account. Please give me a moment while I pull up your account.
Agent-Freehand : Allow me few minutes.
Agent-Freehand : I would like to share that the offer for the bundle price $111.11/mo before equipment charges and taxes and fees does not include the $111 Google and nest devices. It would be $111.11/mo that includes the Google offer for $111 .
Agent-Freehand : The total charges for the $111.11/mo + equipment charges and taxes and fees included would be $111.11/mo which includes the Google offer.
Customer : thats not what my screen says
Customer : why extra 1 dollars
Agent-Freehand : If you are getting the Google offer with the $111.11/mo bundle price from your end I would request you to proceed with the order from your end as the total would be the same which would be 111.11/mo including taxes and fees. I can't assure the Google offer with the $111.11/mo bundle price as it is not included in your account with that bundle price.
Customer : ok thanks
Customer : Customer closed the chat window.
System : SALE OCCURRED
