Customer : ?
Agent-Freehand : Louis, I can see that currently you have ABC Internet 111/111 and ABC Tv Custom and your Term is expiring on 11/11/1111 and your discounts are expiring on 11/11/1111
Customer : my 1 yr contract expires 11-11-11 correct
Agent-Freehand : Yes.
Customer : probably switching to another provider
Customer : so no early cancelation penalty as of 11-11-11
Agent-Freehand : No.
Agent-Freehand : Would you like to see some deals available for renewal?
Customer : fits getting too expensive
Customer : ABC
Customer : do I return on the 11th or should I return on the 11th?
Agent-Freehand : Just to confirm, are you referring to returning of the equipments?
Customer : yes
Customer : I have 1 boxes
Customer : rest of equipment  is mine
Agent-Freehand : You have to call our Consumer Sales and Solutions Center at 1-111 ABC (1-111-111-1111) for cancellation. They will provide you the date for cancellation and date for returning the equipmants.
Agent-Freehand : equipments*
Agent-Freehand : I understand that our competitors are offering some lucrative rates for services; however, once their introductory period expires their price hikes to almost double. Unlike our competitors at ABC we value our customer and we are committed to give them best value for their money. I can assure you that you will not find the same quality of service at the same rates with our competitors while renewing the services.
Agent-Freehand : Can you help me with your requirements, so that I can make a best bundle for renewal with discounts and offers?
Customer : same like I have now
Agent-Freehand : Thank You. Please allow me a moment.
Customer : direct tv is offering me a lot more for a lot less
Agent-Freehand : I can understand. But there services wouldn't be great as ABC. You have been with ABC for 1 years and you know that.
Customer : so what can u offer me 
Customer : it has to be substantially cheaper
Agent-Freehand : I'm working on it. Please allow me a moment.
Agent-Freehand : Louis, I can see that in you current term you are getting a $11 discount and your monthly charges are $111/mo. 
With renewal with the same services your bill will become $111.11 including $11 discount on bundle and $111 towards Google and Nest Devices.
Customer : y would I stay with fins then if my bill will be more expensive
Customer : direct tv is $111 with same service
Customer : and with 1 boxes not 1
Agent-Freehand : I can understand, but that is the best renewal price available on your account.
Customer : I need cheaper not more expensive I guess fits doesn't appreciate customer loyalty
Agent-Freehand : There is another offer in your account where you can get Gigabit Connection. Would you like to review that?
Customer : ill just be returning equipment  thank you for your help
Customer : no thx have a nice day
Agent-Freehand : Thank You for your time. Have a Nice Day ahead.
