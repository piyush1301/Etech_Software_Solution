Agent-Freehand : I appreciate your efforts!
Agent-Freehand : I have now rechecked this for you.
Agent-Freehand : I see that I have to send a technician who would check the lines physically. In case the technician finds any issue with the equipment provided by ABC, there will be no charge.
Agent-Freehand : If there is any trouble found with the equipment not provided by ABC then there will be a possible charge for the repair and it will be informed by the technician. Is this okay with you?
Agent-Freehand : Not to rush, may I know if we are still connected?
Customer : no, I can’t afford to take a chance of being charged for something I can afford. Just have them check and confirm the ABC stuff is operational 
Agent-Freehand : Sure. We will take care of the issue.

Agent-Freehand : Thank you for being a valued ABC customer.
Agent-Freehand : I am sorry to hear that you are looking to cancel the ABC home phone service.
Agent-Freehand : May I know the reason to cancel it?
Customer : I can’t afford 111+ every month. It’s ridiculous. I lost my husband a few months ago and am looking to cut back on stuff I can’t afford. 
Customer : I even asked if I could “be a new customer” since stuff is in my husbands name and I was trying to change it to mine. But no one was willing to work with me
Agent-Freehand : I am sorry to hear the news about your husband.
Customer : thank you 
Agent-Freehand : You can transfer the service in your name. You will just need to call our Consumer Solution Center. A rep will be happy to assist you with that. 

I understand that the cost is a concern for you these days.
Agent-Freehand : Let me share that ABC offers more discount with more services. So, customers can enjoy the services at best available price. 

You will lose your special triple bundle discount by removing home phone service. So, I would recommend you to stay with triple play package to secure triple bundle savings. 

You are loyal ABC customer. Your business and savings means a lot to us. I will put my all efforts to check the best deal available to you to lower the bill.
Agent-Freehand : Would you like to check the deals to lower the bill and retain with triple play package?
Customer : sure, tell me what you have available 
Agent-Freehand : Thank you very much for giving me permission to assist you.
Agent-Freehand : To assist you better, I will need to confirm few details. Once I verify details, I will check your current plans and charges. Then I will check the options to lower the bill, share new price and process the order.

I appreciate for your constant support during chat.
