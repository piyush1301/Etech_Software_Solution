Agent-Freehand : And no promotions are included with keeping old Ultimate HD
Agent-Freehand : With switching to new Ultimate HD 1111 TV plan you are getting better discounts and promotions!
Customer : currently I'm paying 111.11 monthly with my current plan which does not include HBO. i would like it to go down no up please
Agent-Freehand : In that case the best option to go with lower TV plan since you need to lower the price because with Ultimate HD TV the deals I shared are the best available deals on your account,.
