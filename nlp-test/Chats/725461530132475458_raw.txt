Customer : k
Agent-Freehand : Thank you Kevin!
Agent-Freehand : I appreciate your patience.
Agent : While I take care of this for you, let me ask you a few questions to make sure you arenâ€™t missing out on anything.
Agent : What are your must have TV stations/networks?
Customer : none really...just the networks I have now
Agent-Freehand : Okay.
Agent-Freehand : I have just send you the price breakdown to abc@abc.com
Customer : got it...looks to be an increase each month
Agent-Freehand : Also you will be getting $111 toward Google and Nest devices  for the renewal and being a valued customer to ABC.
Customer : I was looking to do better on pricing, not worse
Agent-Freehand : This is the best deal I can get keeping all the services same.
Customer : Can I apply the $111 for Google services-that I don't use- toward my ABC bill?
Agent-Freehand : I am so sorry that would not be possible.
Customer : ok...will get back to you....seems to me every time I see a Comcast or ABC commercial things are supposed to be much cheaper than what I'm paying...will need to research further
Agent-Freehand : I would have surely added more discounts if it was possible for me.
Customer : I appreciate that...it just seems like NEW customers get better deals than loyal EXISTING customers
Agent-Freehand : I would like to share that the deals you are referring to includes some introductory discounts added associated with primary order only. These are the discounts you also got once you signed up for the services.
Customer : I realize that, but it appears to me that I would be rewarded for switching at this point
Agent-Freehand : I totally understand your concern.
Customer : thanks for your help, have a nice day
Agent-Freehand : Also I would like to share that  you are getting the best discount which even new customers won't get.
Customer : Customer closed the chat window.
